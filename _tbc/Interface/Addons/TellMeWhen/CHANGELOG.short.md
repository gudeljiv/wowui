
## v12.0.0
* WoW Midnight support. 
* TBC Classic Anniversary support.
* Timer bars now choose their start/completion color based on the default shading style of the cooldown sweep for the icon type. This means that buff/debuff and similar icons start at the Completion Color (default green) and move towards the Start Color (default red) as they expire.
* Bar icons can now have smoothing enabled (most useful on Resource Display icons). Midnight only.
* Fix: #2311 error caused by IconModule_IconEventConditionHandler enabling unconditionally
