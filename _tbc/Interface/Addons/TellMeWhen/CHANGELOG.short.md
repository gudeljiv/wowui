
## v12.0.3
* Groups can now inherit their opacity from an icon. This allows an entire group to take on opacity that is driven by a secret aspect, like cooldown readiness or spell casting state. This also allows using an icon's conditions to drive group opacity.
* The Spell Cast condition can detect secret casts if the spell filter is empty and the "Casting" checkbox is chosen.
* Fix: Prevent secrets in the import/export menu, which would break scrolling.
* Fix: Incorrect stack text shown on item cooldown icons.
