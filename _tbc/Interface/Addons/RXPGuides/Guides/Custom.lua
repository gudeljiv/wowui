#sticky
+Welcome to the RXP 70-71 Prep guide!
+Start with the Collectible Items and Launch Prep Guide chapters, as they will prepare you for all the quests you'll be turning in on launch. Complete them in full, turn in all quests it says to turn in. These are questlines you leave in the open world, not quests you keep in your quest log!
+Next, do the 25 Quest Log guide, these are quests you leave in your quest log. It is recommended you do around 24 quests and not the full 25 to make sure you have room for prepped quests on launch day. Do not do this guide before the previous step or you will need to backtrack!
+Then check out Turn In Day Speed Assistant to speed up your turn in route
+Lastly, you are good to use the Turn In Guide on launch day!
+Right now the Turn In guide is not out yet to prevent accidental use.
step << skip
+Once you finish the guide, it is highly recommended you copy your character over to the PTR and give the Turn in Guide a test whirl on the PTR so you know the route better!

If this chapter of the guide says to turn something in, turn it in! It's okay and you won't lose out on exp. Just don't turn in any quests it doesn't tell you to, those are the ones we're saving. They will be turned in by following the "Turn in Guide".
