# Wide Quest Log Plus
A World of Warcraft: Classic 1.14.4+ user interface addon that provides a dual-pane quest log with embedded quest levels and quest ids.

Wide Quest Log Plus combines the functionality of three different quest log addons and updates them for the new 1.14.4+ WoW Classic Hardcore servers. Ideal for players who want to retain the look of a native user interface with a few modern advancements. The quest level aids hardcore players in understanding the intended difficulty of a particular quest (although some quests are still considered dangerous far their intended level). The quest ID allows players to easily identify the quest in any third-party websites, tools, and mods.

<h4>Features</h4>

- Full quest list in the left-pane with quest details relocaated to the right pane
- Custom textures added to maintain the look and feel of the original interface
- Quest levels added to the quest titles in the quest list (left-pane)
- Quest ids added to the quest title in the quest details (right-pane)
- Ability to shift+click link quests in chat
- Ability to shift+click quests to enable quest tracking
- Previously advertised seamless ElvUI integration [untested]

<h4>Known Issues / To-Do</h4>

- Enable tracking of greater than 5 quests simultaneously - I've submitted feedback to Blizzard to have this increased in the PTR, but don't know if they have plans to increase the number of simultaneously tracked quests beyond 5. I hope to find a way.
- Test with ElvUI, Masque, and various other popular UI frameworks
- Create options commands and/or window to enable/disable the 3 features
