09/02/2020 version 3.0.0
Select has been completely rewritten. Changes include:
- This version supports Retail (8.3), Shadowlands (9.0) and Classic (1.13) clients. Elements that aren't available on Classic (such as mount:search, toy:search and profession:search) will not be loaded or enabled. Note: for Shadowlands beta/ptr or Classic clients, you'll need to load out of date addons.
- New filter equipslot:<slot> will allow you to select and equip items for the given slot. For instance: /select equipslot:13 will let you swap trinkets to the top trinket slot on a right-click of the macro, and use the top trinket on a left-click or keybind of the macro.
- You can choose which direction a flyout opens with flyout:<direction> in the macro. For instance /select equipslot:14, flyout:left will open a flyout to the left of the button containing the macro.
- To select items or spells with commas in their name, surround them with quotes, such as: /select Magic Rooster, "Yulei, Daughter of Jade", Core Hound.
- Right click will select an item or spell from the flyout menu now.
- The /select command by itself will summon the options window.
- The options window has been updated to reflect new settings, filters and more information on usage.
- Added new option 'Use Flat Style' to display flyouts and their buttons in a flatter style.
- Added new option 'Show Subtext on Spell Tooltips'. When spells have a subtext such as Heal(Rank 1) or Polymorph(Turtle) it will add the subtext to tooltips. This is default enabled in Classic WoW where spell ranks play a greater role.
- Added new option 'Select Only Soulbound Equipslots' to not include bind-on-equip gear that you loot into select flyouts.
- Added new option 'Use Item Or Spell On Right Click' that will make right-clicks mimic the behavior of the Alt modifier, and use an item or spell as it's selected. Note: for equipslot:<slot>, selecting will always equip the item regardless of click or modifier.
- If the option 'Use But Don't Select with Alt' is enabled, this will also apply to the Right Click if 'Use With Right Click' is enabled.
- When units are involved in conditionals (out of range, invalid, etc), the macro should now reflect that unit during the condition (if the action button/bars supports this behavior) before the action is used.
- Items in the flyout now have a colored border to reflect their rarity, if applicable.
- Open flyouts can now be dismissed with the ESCape key (or whatever you've mapped to the game menu) while in combat.
- Passive spells will no longer show in spell:search filters (but you can add them separately to a /select if you still want them).
- When a filter:search is used, items and spells are added to the flyout in alphabetical order for that specific filter:search. For instance "/select Magic Rooster, type:Quest, spell:Portal" will add the Magic Rooster first, then all quest items sorted alphabetically, then all Portal spells sorted alphabetically last.
- Mounts found as the result of a mount:search that are not currently summonable will now add to flyouts, such as the Darkwater Skate that only works under water.
- Added new option 'Only Select Summonable Mounts' to remove these mounts that can't be currently summoned from mount:search flyouts.
- Flyout button creation is deferred until needed.
- Fix for some default flyout spells like spell:Polymorph only picking one spell.
- Removed the need to aggressively set attributes or build flyouts.
- Flyouts that cease to be used are no longer filled.

Notes for users of Select 2.x:
- Options like 'Use But Don't Select with Alt' will carry over from 2.x to 3.x.
- All existing /select macros should continue to work without change.
- After updating from 2.x to 3.x, the initial loaded selection from every flyout will reset to the first available item or spell across all characters. This one-time reset is due way selected items and spells are saved.
- If you're updating this manually, you will need to exit the game completely before updating. There are new files that won't be recognized if added while logged into the game.
- This version has considerably changed the files/folders in the Select addon folder. If you feel comfortable doing it, you can delete the old one before installing this. But the old files are harmless if they remain, they will not be loaded. Auto-updating clients may possibly do this for you too.
