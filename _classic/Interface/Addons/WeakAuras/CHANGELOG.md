# [5.8.0](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/tree/5.8.0) (2023-10-08)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/compare/5.7.2...5.8.0)

## Highlights

 - This is a re-release of 5.7.2 with a proper version number and two bug fixes.

- NOTE: This version has a change that affects some aura's scaling. If you log in and things look different and you just want them to look the same as before, go to the "Position Settings" in the "Display" tab and disable "Set Parent to Anchor".

- If, after doing that, things still don't look right, please create an issue! As always making a backup of your settings before upgrading is a good idea. Please be aware that trying to revert to an old version of WeakAuras will brick your data, we fixed an issue with that but for this upgrade, make sure you do your backup before trying to revert to an older release.

- Also, if you shared your aura with someone and they say it broke their auras, don't panic and let them know that all they have to do is to update the WeakAuras addon.
