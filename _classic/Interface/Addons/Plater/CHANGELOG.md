@January 1st, 2024:
- Added, on Mythic Dungeon Tools (Nnoggie), options to edit the Npc and Spell on Plater Nameplates.
- Added in the Npc Colors editor, a button, to see which spells the npc casts, in the Cast Colors editor.
- Holding SHIFT when selecting a new color for a spell or npc, will replace the current color on all npcs or spells which are using it.
- Color selection dropdowns now show its options ordered by RGB values (from pink, green, blue and to red).
- When importing npc colors, the original npc and zone name from the local client is preserved (was overwriting).
- Script selector preview, at the cast color editor tab, now correctly shows the animation when hovering over the thumbnail.
- Fixed the search boxes on the Npc and Spell editor tabs, they should search much faster with the help of bug fixes and caches.
- The button to send a npc color customization to the raid is now working properly.
- Added Plater.OpenNpcColorsPanel(searchString) and Plater.OpenCastColorsPanel(searchString) to open the options panel and search for a npc or spell.
