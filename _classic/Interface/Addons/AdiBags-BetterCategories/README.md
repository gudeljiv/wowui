# Better Categories for AdiBags Classic

The wonderful AdiBags addon contains a filter for automatically classifying
items by the categories and subcategories given my the game itself.
Unfortunately, the way the game categorizes items is often unhelpful, and you
may have been annoyed in the past at the addon throwing all your ores, herbs,
and cloth onto one "Trade Goods" pile. This extra filter for AdiBags aims to
solve this problem by using WowHead-inspired classifications, as well as some
further manual classifications, to make your inventory management easier. It
works for trade goods and consumables, splitting them up into more relevant
categories like "Metal", "Meat", "Gems", "Elixirs", and so forth.

This addon fits seamlessly into the existing AdiBags framework, and can be
configured, re-ordered, and disabled like any other AdiBags filter.
