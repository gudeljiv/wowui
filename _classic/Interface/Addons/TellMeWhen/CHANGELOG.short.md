## v10.2.0
* Version bumps for all WoW versions. 
* Fixed classic client detection.
* Fix #2119 - Handle Blizzard's new, poorly-introduced range check restrictions.
* Fix #2121 - Efflorescence is now just a buff, no longer a totem. If you were using the Efflorescence icon type (which will now just show as "Totem"), switch to using a buff/debuff icon.
* Workaround #2114 - Most textures become Avenging Wrath when Avenging Wrath is glyphed.
