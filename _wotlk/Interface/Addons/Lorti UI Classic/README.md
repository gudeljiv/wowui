# Lorti-UI-Classic
Lorti UI updated for Classic WoW.

Seen many streamers using Lorti UI and everyone seems to be getting LUA errors and frames not being colored correctly. Figured i would put my mediocre LUA skills to use and fix it.

Still have a few things not colored correctly and the code looks like crap. Will look to improve it over time!

If you find any bugs/issues please send me a message on Discord Chordsy#8773 and i'll try to fix it asap. If you get a LUA error please copy the text or send a screenshot. It helps a lot!
