[Full Changelog](https://github.com/papa-smurf/Gargul/compare/v5.3.5...v5.3.6) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/papa-smurf/Gargul/releases)

- Version v5.3.6  
- Added a "Show everything when using prio3/classicpr.io" because people quite often can't seem to spell their own character names  
- When clearing your classicpr.io/prio3/DFT data, the correct importer will now be opened instead of the default TMB importer  
- Fixed an issue where importing prios from classicpr.io would throw an incorrect "players without prio" warning  
- Added a prio3 command for classicpr.io (/gl prio3)  
- Added TMB raid groups to tooltips when more than one raid group is available (can be disabled via /gl > TMB and DFT)  
- Solidified all table sorts to prevent all possible lua errors  
- Fixed a sorting issue that could prevent the GDKP module from working
