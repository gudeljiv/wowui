**Getting the addon**

If anyone would like to test it, you can just download it from the releases on the wowsims under [Addon] and you can also find it on Curseforge


**To use the addon**

    /wse - will open up the options window - *wip* changes do nothing atm
    /wse open - will open the exporter window.
    /wse export will open the exporter window, generate the data, and have the data ready and highlighted for you to CTRL+C

If you change your gear, and enchants or some gems, you can either rerun `/wse export` if you closed the window and the data will be updated. or just click the `Generate Data` button.

**To find the import button**

You must go to Options and enable experimental in order to import from the addon!

This will add a addon button to the import type list.
