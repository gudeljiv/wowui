- Fixed an issue with macros to change the Display and Segment of a window  
- Moving Avoidance and Auras tab code to their own separate files  
    This should clean up and make the player breakdown file even smaller  
- Moved the code for the builtin compare tab to a new file  
    This cleans up 2000 lines from the Player Breakdown Window file  
- Finished instance:SetDisplay(segmentId, attributeId, subAttributeId, modeId) and instance:SetSegment(segmentId)
