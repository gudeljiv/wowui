10/25/2022 version 3.4.2
- Update for Dragonflight clients.
- Fix for 10.0.0 clients inability to use selection action.
- Note: For pre-patch clients (10.0.0), /select needs two more characters in a macro to do its thing. If your /select macros were 254+ characters, this will cut them short. In 10.0.2 the need for two extra characters may be going away.

10/19/2022 version 3.4.1
- Fix for Dragonflight beta clients (10.0.2) inability to use selected action.
- Known issue: Alt+click and right click of flyout buttons are behaving as an unmodified left click. This should be corrected soon.

10/04/2022 version 3.4.0
- Update for Dragonflight client support
- Beta/PTR users will need to load out of date addons for this to work until the Dragonflight Pre-Patch
- Added no:<search> filter to exclude items and spells added by previous filters. eg. /select toy:Hearthstone, no:Card will remove the Autographed Hearthstone Card from the flyout
- Select will be a bit more assertive on control of the icon for /select macros to fix issues with macro icons not updating
- Removed broken 'Don't Override #showtooltip' option

Note: On Dragonflight clients, two more characters are needed for the macro length "tax". If your /select macros already hit the 255 macro length, they may not function as expected. Shadowlands and Classic clients should not be affected.

- Updated interface options panel to include rows:<number> help.
- Option 'Don't Override #showtooltip' will now prompt for a reload, since changing this option requires a reload.

08/22/2021 version 3.1.2
- Added a search cache to improve performance when equipslot, item, spell, mount or toy search filters are used.
- Initialization now waits for the data load pass of the cache to complete.
- Rather than waiting until you need to use a flyout (or entering combat during which flyouts can't be changed), flyouts are now filled slowly over time upon login to cache them.

- Potential fix for rank 10+ appearing before rank 9 in ranks:search flyouts on BCC/Classic clients.
- Updated toc for 9.1.0 patch

06/19/2021 version 3.1.0
- Added ranks:search filter for Classic Era and The Burning Crusade Classic Clients (not Retail), to add all ranks of a spell to a flyout. /select ranks:Curse of Agony will add all ranks of spells containing Curse of Agony in its name to the flyout. (If you've turned off the option Show Subtext on Spell Tooltips, you may want to turn it back on if you use this filter; so ranks display in the tooltips.)
- Updated interface options panel for the new ranks:search, made the retail-only (and new classic-only) notifications a different color to stand out, and renamed Retail to Modern clients.
- Some global references made local

09/28/2020 version 3.0.2

09/24/2020 version 3.0.1
- Potential fix for issues caching toys on cold login and when new toys learned.

09/02/2020 version 3.0.0
Select has been completely rewritten. Changes include:
- This version supports Retail (8.3), Shadowlands (9.0) and Classic (1.13) clients. Elements that aren't available on Classic (such as mount:search, toy:search and profession:search) will not be loaded or enabled. Note: for Shadowlands beta/ptr or Classic clients, you'll need to load out of date addons.
- New filter equipslot:<slot> will allow you to select and equip items for the given slot. For instance: /select equipslot:13 will let you swap trinkets to the top trinket slot on a right-click of the macro, and use the top trinket on a left-click or keybind of the macro.
- You can choose which direction a flyout opens with flyout:<direction> in the macro. For instance /select equipslot:14, flyout:left will open a flyout to the left of the button containing the macro.
- To select items or spells with commas in their name, surround them with quotes, such as: /select Magic Rooster, "Yulei, Daughter of Jade", Core Hound.
- Right click will select an item or spell from the flyout menu now.
- The /select command by itself will summon the options window.
- The options window has been updated to reflect new settings, filters and more information on usage.
- Added new option 'Use Flat Style' to display flyouts and their buttons in a flatter style.
- Added new option 'Show Subtext on Spell Tooltips'. When spells have a subtext such as Heal(Rank 1) or Polymorph(Turtle) it will add the subtext to tooltips. This is default enabled in Classic WoW where spell ranks play a greater role.
- Added new option 'Select Only Soulbound Equipslots' to not include bind-on-equip gear that you loot into select flyouts.
- Added new option 'Use Item Or Spell On Right Click' that will make right-clicks mimic the behavior of the Alt modifier, and use an item or spell as it's selected. Note: for equipslot:<slot>, selecting will always equip the item regardless of click or modifier.
- If the option 'Use But Don't Select with Alt' is enabled, this will also apply to the Right Click if 'Use With Right Click' is enabled.
- When units are involved in conditionals (out of range, invalid, etc), the macro should now reflect that unit during the condition (if the action button/bars supports this behavior) before the action is used.
- Items in the flyout now have a colored border to reflect their rarity, if applicable.
- Open flyouts can now be dismissed with the ESCape key (or whatever you've mapped to the game menu) while in combat.
- Passive spells will no longer show in spell:search filters (but you can add them separately to a /select if you still want them).
- When a filter:search is used, items and spells are added to the flyout in alphabetical order for that specific filter:search. For instance "/select Magic Rooster, type:Quest, spell:Portal" will add the Magic Rooster first, then all quest items sorted alphabetically, then all Portal spells sorted alphabetically last.
- Mounts found as the result of a mount:search that are not currently summonable will now add to flyouts, such as the Darkwater Skate that only works under water.
- Added new option 'Only Select Summonable Mounts' to remove these mounts that can't be currently summoned from mount:search flyouts.
- Flyout button creation is deferred until needed.
- Fix for some default flyout spells like spell:Polymorph only picking one spell.
- Removed the need to aggressively set attributes or build flyouts.
- Flyouts that cease to be used are no longer filled.

Notes for users of Select 2.x:
- Options like 'Use But Don't Select with Alt' will carry over from 2.x to 3.x.
- All existing /select macros should continue to work without change.
- After updating from 2.x to 3.x, the initial loaded selection from every flyout will reset to the first available item or spell across all characters. This one-time reset is due way selected items and spells are saved.
- If you're updating this manually, you will need to exit the game completely before updating. There are new files that won't be recognized if added while logged into the game.
- This version has considerably changed the files/folders in the Select addon folder. If you feel comfortable doing it, you can delete the old one before installing this. But the old files are harmless if they remain, they will not be loaded. Auto-updating clients may possibly do this for you too.
