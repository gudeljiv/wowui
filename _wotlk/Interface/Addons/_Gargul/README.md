## When should I use Gargul?
- If you use softres, tmb, dft or a combination of these
- https://softres.it: see who reserved what, who forgot to reserve, announce details it in chat etc
- https://thatsmybis.com:  see wishlist/prio info, item notes, export loot back into TMB etc
- Gargul tracks player rolls for you and speeds up assigning loot drastically!
- It picks up loot automatically and can send it to anyone in the raid
- It shows you exactly how long you still have before you need to start handing out loot
