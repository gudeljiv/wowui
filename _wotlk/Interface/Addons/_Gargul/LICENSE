"But it's on GitHub, so I can do what I want!". No, you can't.

The most common misconception about open-source projects is if a GitHub project
has no license, then it’s okay to use. If a repository has no license, then
all rights are reserved by law, and it is not open-source or free. You cannot modify
or redistribute this code without explicit permission from the copyright holder.

You can fork it, you can copy it, you can present it to others as-is, but you can't
modify any of it in any way shape or form as per GitHub's ToS and this LICENSE.
