- Update localization.ru.lua (#1025)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#1024)  
- Add sound to AddMsg object for news or missing module messages  
- Make sure Sunken Temple triggers the missing raid modules message  
    Updates to news message to only show once on login, but now also show on raid zone in and pulling or wiping to raid bosses (if the module is still missing). The point of message isn't to be annoying, it's literally to have users fix their mods so they stop coming in saying "my dbm is broken, how do I fix it" when dbm has been saying how to in game for WEEKS.  
- tweak spam notice to only perform if actively in a raid.  
- and add sod to vanilla  
- spam the message every 1 minute, indefinitely until user solves the issue.
