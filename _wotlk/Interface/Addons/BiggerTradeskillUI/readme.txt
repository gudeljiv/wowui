This World of Warcraft addon resizes the Tradeskill UI to the same size of the spellbook. 
This gives more space to have easier access to the filters and a have a longer list.

You can make the list even longer by resizing the window by dragging the bottom border of 
the Tradeskill window.

Has support for:
- Auctionator
- Aurora
- ElvUI
- Tradeskill Info

Works with most tradeskill addons (that work with the default Blizzard UI) like:
- TradeTabs
- Overachiever
