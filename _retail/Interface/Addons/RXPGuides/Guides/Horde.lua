+To solo this quest you need to play correctly in 2 ways. First of all you need to not die to breath, that means before you aggro the boss you should have full breath. The second thing to be aware of is that you need to kick EVERY frostbolt you can and use evasion after a kick. Most of his damage will be from frostbolts. Remember you can vanish and try again 5 mins later, aslong as you don't die to breath.
