	YE OLDE HELP TEXT

	Okay, to clarify, there's multiple ways to write a map link now. It's a mess, but it works.

	The first, simplest way, is two nodes linked, written in plain text (let's hope they're accessible by some means):
		"First Zone/2 11.22,33.44 -x- Second Zone/3 55.66,77.88",

	The "-x-" means it's a crossing, two-way. You can use "-to-" to make a one-way link.


	NODE NAMES:

	Adding @something after the node coordinates gives the node a name, for later reuse.
		"Stormwind 11.22,33.44 -x- Elwynn Forest 55.66,77.88 @stormgate",
		"Elwynn 77.77,66.66 -x- @stormgate",

	You can also use @+ to indicate the last node created or mentioned, whether it was named or not.
		"Stormwind 11.22,33.44 -x- Elwynn Forest 55.66,77.88",
		"@+ -x- Elwynn 77.77,66.66",

	This allows for easy chaining of nodes.


	ONE NODE?

	You can create just one node:
		"Solitary 11.1,22.2"

	This only makes sense if you @+ link to it later, or give it an explicit @name and refer to that.


	ADDITIONAL NODE DATA:

	Writing <field:value> after a node's coordinates assigns additional data.
		"Stormwind 11.1,22.2 <title:Watch out, dog poo> <radius:5>"

	Data fields include (among others):
		'title' to caption a node,
		'radius' to set the node's player-detection radius,
		'region' to assign a node to a special region,
		'nofly' set to 1 means the node cannot be flown to,
		'dark' set to 1 means the node can only be seen by the player from a small distance, but suffers no penalty when chained between other nodes


	ADDITIONAL LINK DATA:

	Writing {field:value} after both nodes assigns data to their link:
		"Stormwind 11.1,22.2 -x- Elwynn Forest 55.5,66.6 {cost:999}"   -- this is a very time-costly connection


	ADVANCED FORMAT:

	If that's not enough, you can use a "raw" format to write node links:
		{ "@+" , "Orgrimmar/1 11.1,22.2" , template="portalauto", faction="H", cost=123 }

	Within that, you can go even deeper and write the node(s) in raw mode, too:
		{ "@+" , {"Orgrimmar/1 11.1,22.2",title="Something in Orgri",region="whatever"} , oneway=1 }

	Very advanced, messy, "fake zone"-based mapping (Maraudon the Zone of Nightmares) makes extensive use of that.

	These lines define how each point's text displays, depending on their "situation".
	The keys of this dictionary adhere to a quirky, but logical pattern of "a_b__c_d", which means:
		a = "this type of connection"
		_ = "to"
		b = "this type of point"
		_ = "and"
		_ = "then"
		c = "that type of connection"
		_ = "to"
		d = "that type of point".
	So, a "start" point that you "walk" to (all paths start like that), after which you'll "fly" to a "border" point, is in a situation of "walk_start__fly_border" ("walk to start, and then fly to border").
	You can supply just "a_b", or just "b".
	A point attribute <template:nameoftemplate> overrides the point's basic type for the purpose of this list. Thus, a point can stay a "portal", but have the flavour of "portalclick" if it has a <template:portalclick> attribute and have a special display of "Click portal", matching a "portalclick" type.
	A connection attribute {template:nameoftemplate} overrides the mode of transport for the purpose of this list. Thus, if a connection has {template:portalauto} one can match for "portalauto_*" to show descriptions for that connection, or match for "*_*__portalauto_*" to match for NEXT connection's type and perhaps show an appropriate text on the previous node before a portal.
	A connection attribute that is not found in this list, is looked up in the list above, for easy two-way descriptions.
	Asterisks denote wildcards.
	One can also use the text part of the dictionary to refer to other entries in the list.
	Entries are checked in the file's order. First match gets the cake.

	So, for example: 
		"taxi" - matches points of type "taxi", to display them as "Talk to {npc}\nFly to {next_name}, {next_map}".
		"portalauto" - matches points of template "portalauto", to display them as "Enter portal to {next_map}".
		"*_*__pinkportal" - matches any point AFTER which there's a pinkportal connection.
