# FarmLog
World of Warcraft Classic addon that logs loot, monster kills, honor and instances. Know exactly what your farm session has yielded.

### What it is for
You can track your farming session and know how much gold/hour you make. Good for general grinding, instance item farming, rep farm, tradeskill work, honor farm, know how many you killed in a rare BoE farm, etc etc.

FarmLog now tracks Black Lotus picking and shows respawn timers! (need DBM addon for timer bars)

### What it does
* Tracks 
    * Shows Gold/Hour of active farming session
    * Farm session time with a stopwatch
    * Mob kills, counts how many of each mob was killed
    * Loot from mobs and quests
    * Herbalism, skinning and mining yield
    * Money loot, displays total gold collected
    * Shows loot vendor value in gold
    * Reputation gain per faction
    * XP gained
    * Skill levels
    * Honor gain (not tested yet, will be available in phase 2)
    * Black Lotus pick time and location
* Allows reporting farm results
* Display farm yield in a window with all looted items
* Allows filtering item poor and common items
* Save multiple farm sessions, you can switch to a different session and continue from where you left off. Read more about Sessions below.
* When a Black Lotus is picked, it will log the time, zone and coords. You can see it by clicking the BL in your session log
* If you have DBM installed, it'll start a timer for next spawn. It persists through logout / playing alts.

### How to install
* Download, extract (if zipped)
* Make sure folder doesn't have `-master` surffix
* Copy `FarmLog` folder to your `WoW\Interface\AddOns` folder

### How to use
* `/fl` - toggle logging on/off
* `/fl r` - reset log
* `/fl s` - shows log
* `/fl set <ITEMLINK> <GOLDVALUE>` - sets AH value of an item, in gold

### Sessions 
Many times you pause your farming to do something else in game, like doing an instance and afterwards continue to farm herbs. So you want to know how much herb farming yields and how much the instance run has yielded, but these are two different sessions! That's why you can name sessions and switch between them according to what you're doing. 

Another thing is that the more time & data you have per session, the more accurate gold/hour metric you're going to see. For example, you can `/fl switch Herbing` when collecting herbs and `/fl switch Fishing` whenever you fish, do that for a week and you'll get a reasonably accurate gold/hour metric.

### Frequently Asked Questions
**Why do some items appear under "Unknown"?**
 When a loot log messages arrives, it does not contain the mob name that dropped it. Assuming that it came from the last killed mob because one may kill multiple mobs and later loot them all. So we need a loot window to appear, we then know what loot that mob dropped and make correct attribution.
 Sometimes, a loot is received without any loot window being opened, like for instance when someone in your group loots a mob with green item and you win the roll. In this case, the addon won't know which mob dropped it.
 This may also happen if you have addons like "Leatrix Plus" with "Fast loot" option enabled. This causes loot to be received before loot window is opened, so the addon doesn't know where it came from.
