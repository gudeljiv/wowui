Puggle
by Cixi@Remulos (Classic Oceanic)

WHAT THE ADDON IS FOR:
  Puggle is there to help you find a group, by showing you all the group request spammed into any of your active channels
  The players will appear in the clean list sorted by dungeon, with their class and level displayed for convenience.
  You can then directly contact any player via the whisper button and check if they are interested to join you. 
  The addon also lets you rate any player you have grouped with, and allows you to upload those ratings to http://warcraftratings.com/puggle/upload
  The website then shows you the consolidated ratings of players on their realms.


INSTALLATION:
  - Copy the "Puggle" folder into your Wow Classic \Interface\AddOns\ folder
  - Restart World of Warcraft Classic
 
  
HOW TO ACTIVATE:
  use the slash command /puggle or /pug
  or click the minimap button (click again to hide)
  
   
HOW IT WORKS:
  The addon continually checks the channels you have joined for any message that looks like a group request.
  If it finds one, it matches it against any dungeon it recognises and finds the class and level of the requester.
  The addon will then list all such players and their requests in its friendly interface and keep them there for 5 minutes.
  If a requester 'refreshes' his request (updated message for example) the timer is reset.
  
 
LOCALIZATION:
The default release comes with search terms in English (LFG / Ragefire / Sunken etc) which works well for players on the US/UK client, but not so well for our friends in Germany, France, China or wherever English is not the preferred language.
To help with that, the search patterns can now be updated directly inside the addon, by going to Settings > Customize Search Patterns
Feel free to edit them to suit your needs
    

RELEASE NOTES:
Please see the RELEASE_NOTES.md file

KNOWN ISSUES:
There are some known issue we are working on:
- A player in the group getting mind controlled might throw a lua error.
- The addon currently only looks at players in your group. In a raid situation, the addon will not track any of the players in other groups.


CONTACT:
  Feel free to post suggestions and comments on either Curse or WoWInterface. 
  I won't promise I'll respond, but if I see some cool suggestions I might decide to implement them!
  
  May the Earth Mother protect you all.
