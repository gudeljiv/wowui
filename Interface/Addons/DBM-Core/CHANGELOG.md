[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/compare/1.13.61...bedeb5378b5c991befd26edbe15627a03807bf5d) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Classic/releases)

- Update localization.fr.lua (#631)  
- tweak landslide trample timer  
- Removed infoframe and frozen timer from Viscidous. Phase detection is unreliable and so are counters. This, combined with fact that classic support is being scaled back significantly, measures are being taken to either fix lose ends, or remove them.  
- make dark glare warning/timer show/end 2 seconds earlier Closes #554  
- Several sapphiron and KT fixes. Both probably need more work but this best could be done without transcriptor and extensive debug  
- Cho rush going friendly should now be registered as a victory

- Update localization.cn.lua (#618)  
- Noth Update  
     - Fixed adds trigger for classic, emotes don't exist, have to use yell fallback. Unfortunately this basically means no balcony phase adds timers at the moment.  
     - Adjusted some Adds timers to match classic  
     - Added Blink cast warning  
- Grobbulus Update  
     - Injection target warning will no longer be filtered.  
     - Added optional (off by default) SAY for injection  
     - Tweaked cloud timer to be a cd instead of next, it's not as precise in classic as it is in wrath  
- Thaddius Update  
     - Update thaddius arrow object to a dropdown instead of a series of confusing bool options. Also made the standard 4 group option oni by default. After seeing that PTR, classic players definitely need the handholding.  
     - Updated timers based on public logs and videos, tank throw might still need some work  
     - Fixed phase two trigger. In Classic it uses Monster Message, not raid emote
