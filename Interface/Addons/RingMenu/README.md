# RingMenu
This AddOn for Classic WoW (v. 1.13) adds an additional circular action bar that normally remains hidden but can be summoned by a click of a (mouse) button.

The RingMenu is hence ideal for storing away action buttons that are frequently used yet need not be present on the screen at all times (e.g. trade skills, tracking spells, hearthstone, etc.).

**Note**: RingMenu for Classic WoW is still in Beta. Some features (e.g. animations) are currently missing.

## Setup and Configuration
Go to **Main Menu** > **Interface Options** > **AddOns** > **RingMenu** and use the _Key Binding_ field to choose an appropriate button to open / close the RingMenu.
This can be any keyboard or mouse button (e.g. middle mouse button).

Open the RingMenu by clicking the selected button anywhere on the screen.
You can now drag and drop actions to the slots of the RingMenu like for a regular action bar.

Using the _First Button Slot_ and _Number of Buttons_ settings further down, you can adjust the range of action button slots that are used for the RingMenu. Depending on your class, some button slot ranges might be already in use for shapeshift forms. Use [this list](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/ActionSlot) to pick an appropriate range.

Using the drop down menu at the top of the panel and the **+** and **-** buttons next to it, you can configure several RingMenus which can have different settings and key binds. To easily distinguish RingMenus, you can (optionally) give each one a name.
