# Dejunk Changelog

## 9.1.2

- Removed `Auto Destroy` from the Classic version. Per the PTR, the functionality allowing auto destroy is set to be removed from Classic.
- Removed all destroy filters in favor of Inclusions. Now, when destroying, items will only be marked as junk if they have been added to either the global or profile Inclusions list.
