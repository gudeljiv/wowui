# EavesDrop Classic

The simple visual combat log addon that displays skill/spell icons, and includes detailed mouseover statistics. This addon has [been around since Vanilla and TBC](https://www.wowinterface.com/portal.php?a=newsarchiveitem&id=41&newsid=614), and now it's available for Classic WoW 1.13.2.

## About

First of all I'd just like to mention that I am not the original creator of this addon, and for that you can thank [Grayhoof (original author)](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info5332-EavesDrop.html), and [domzae for his 8.0.1 fix](https://github.com/domzae/EavesDrop). This wasn't just a simple TOC edit, so if you have any problems feel free to [submit any issues](https://github.com/shoestare/EavesDropClassic/issues).
